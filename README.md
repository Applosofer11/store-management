# store-management
Store management application for ING Hubs interview

Create an API that acts as a store management tool

- Create a Github profile if you don't have one

- Use git in a verbose manner, push even if you wrote only one class

- Create a Java, maven based project, Springboot for the web part

- No front-end, you can focus on backend, no need to overcomplicate the structure

- Implement basic functions, for example: add-product, find-product, change-price or others

- Optional: Implement a basic authentication mechanism and role based endpoint access

- Design error mechanism and handling plus logging

- Write unit tests, at least for one class

- Use Java 9+ features

- Add a small Readme to document the project
